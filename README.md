# Mini_rpg_Battle

#This was created as a group final project for a Computer Science class.
#I was personally in charge of most of the classes, with only the map-related classes being handled by the other members.

## DESCRIPTION

# This project allows a user to control a "hero" to explore a "dungeon" and open chests along the way.
  Occasionally, a chest may contain an enemy instead of loot. If this happens, a battle ensues.
  
  When that happens, the user may choose from a variety of options to defeat the enemy before the "hero" is slain instead.
  When the battle is over, the user can go back to collecting treasure.
  This process continues until the user decides to close the program.
  
  
## OTHER DESCRIPTION

# Each "hero" attacking abilities that is unique to them, as well as a healing ability along with their basic attack and defend actions.
  Each "hero" has their own unique resistances and stats, making them more able to go against certain enemies and less able to go against others.
  "Enemies" have their own abilites and resistances
  
  In-code documentation should walk through what everything is and what it does.
